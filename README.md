haxeutils
=========

A set of utility classes that don't really fit anywhere else.

JNIClassBuilder.hx
==================

A class to streamline the process of using JNI functions on Android. Deprecated in favor of [inthebox-macros](https://github.com/shoebox/inthebox-macros).

NDLLClassBuilder.hx
===================

Like JNIClassBuilder, except it generates the code necessary to call C++ functions that have been compiled into an NDLL. Deprecated in favor of [inthebox-macros](https://github.com/shoebox/inthebox-macros).
